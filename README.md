# SUB-EX
This repository contains all the codes used to develop SUB-EX (Submarine Explorer for Underwater Body EXamination), a SSIP project developed by Meet Jain and Co. 

## Abstract 
SUB-EX (Submarine Explorer for Underwater Body EXamination) outlines a project to develop and deploy a 3D-printed underwater submarine designed for inspection and surveillance of submerged constructions and buildings. The submarine is capable of navigating underwater environments to monitor various parameters and provide live video feed to the pilot's screen. SUB-EX aims to enhance the safety and efficiency of underwater inspections by delivering real-time, high-quality visual and data feedback. With potential applications in civil engineering, maintenance of underwater structures like bridges and dams, this project seeks to secure a grant to advance its development, ensuring robust and reliable performance in diverse underwater conditions.

## Objeectives
The objective of SUB-EX is to create a robust, 3D-printed underwater submarine equipped with advanced sensors and high-resolution cameras capable of conducting detailed inspections of various underwater constructions, including dams, bridges, pipelines, and dockyards. This advanced system aims to enhance the safety, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of underwater infrastructure management.
•	The submarine is constructed using cutting-edge 3D printing technology, which allows for a lightweight, customizable, and durable design. The use of waterproof and corrosion-resistant materials ensures the system's robustness in harsh underwater environments. The modular design facilitates easy upgrades and maintenance, ensuring long-term adaptability and scalability.
•	SUB-EX implements advanced navigation and algorithms to enable the submarine to navigate the complex underwater environments so as to conduct comprehensive inspections.
•	It also integrates reliable communication technology which provides live video feeds and real time sensor data to operators facilitating immediate analysis and decision making which so as to avoid potential consequences like infrastructure failures, service disruptions and economic losses
•	It also reduces the dependency on manual diving operations, and hence minimizing risks to human divers and increasing efficiency and frequency of underwater operations. 
•	Along with decreasing the dependency on traditional methods due to 3D printing technology and autonomous operation, the submarine significantly reduces the operational costs associated with underwater inspections. Traditional ROVs, which can start from $6,000 per inspection, are economically prohibitive for many stakeholders. The proposed system offers a more affordable solution, making regular and comprehensive inspections feasible especially for the Indian market.
•	The submarine procures expertise in early detection of structural detects, corrosion and other anomalies to support maintenance tasks. This approach helps extend the lifespan of underwater structures and ensures their continued safety and functionality.
In summary, the 3D-printed underwater inspection and surveillance system is a transformative tool that promises to change the underwater infrastructure management, ensuring enhanced safety, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness in maintaining critical underwater assets.

## Value Proposition
SUB-EX is a vital tool totally meant for underwater infrastructure management, specifically engineered to meet the serious needs for reliable, efficient, and cost-effective inspection and maintenance solutions.
•	It eliminates the need for hazardous manual diving operations, thereby safeguarding human lives. Its autonomous navigation and real-time data transmission capabilities ensure thorough and efficient inspections, significantly reducing downtime and operational risks.
•	It’s a vital tool that provides a very good accuracy in detecting cracks, corrosion, and other structural issues. This capability allows timely and precise maintenance, preventing failures and longevity of the structures. On top of this SUB-EX’s real-time video feeds and sensor data transmission provide instant insights into the condition of underwater structures.
•	The ROVs for the inspections cost more than $6,000 per inspection, however SUB-EX offers a highly cost-effective alternative. This increases the bandwidth of the stakeholders particularly in cost sensitive markets like India.
•	The 3D printed construction allows customizable design making it adaptable even at a depth of 85 Meters. This flexibility ensures that the system can improve with technological advancements and changing inspection needs so as to provide an end-to-end long term and sustainable solution.
•	It can be deployed across multiple industries to inspect diverse underwater environments, from dams and bridges to dockyards and pipelines.
Overall SUB-EX is an emerging tool meant for underwater infrastructure management, ensuring secure, reliable and sustainable infrastructure for the country.
